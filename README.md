# SQL
SQL questions will be added for interview preparation with solutions and technique.<br />
Note : If you don't have LEETCODE SUBSCRIPTION and just want to write code in SQL online complier I've created a python file in the SQL folder for converting the tables present in the questions to CREATE AND INSERT statements which you can execute in online complier and run/debug your code.
ENJOY :)
